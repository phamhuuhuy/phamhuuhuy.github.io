											<dd>Now I am studying RMIT university in Sai Gon. I am a beginner of IT so I felt a little bit nervous in first week of course but now I am better. I have two main hobbies which are hanging out with friends and playing sports. Firstly, playing sports is the most enjoyable activity which I spend most of my free time on. Specifically, I play soccer with my highschool team, we engage in soccer amateur tournament and gain the remarkable achievement. Hanging out with my friends is one of the most effective solutions to reduce stress and anxiety.</dd>

								<p class="content">My experience in IT is Pascal, to be more specific, I studied basic code of Pascal in highschool. 
									The reason why I chose RMIT as the university because I can approach the international environment in my country, learn a range of culture and different productive strategies in education. In addition, English is one of the most vital roles in IT and RMIT is suitable university to improve it. I also have opportunities to gain and expand knowledge as well as skills which can be prepared for my future job. 
									I expect to gain cloud computing, website application, creating coding, IT security and a little bit about game development during my education life due to the fact that I want to be a person who controls the application of company or institute. </p>

									<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
									<p>My ideal job is IT Information Security which can protect the important information for customers as well as company by creating coding or controlling networking. To be specific, reviewing application security design/ architecture for security controls throughout the life-cycle of an application (web-based and mobile).</p>
									<p>I am attracted by it because I will have experiences with professional and transparent working environment. Moreover, I can receive 13th salary fixed and KPI bonus.</p>

									<p>The essential skill which required is programming experience in Python, Java, PowerShell or Shell scripting. In addition, I have about 2 years of experiences in performing web-based, mobile application Penetration Testing. Also, I must be familiar with network/infrastructure-level penetration testing.</p>

									<p>I haven’t had any skills about IT yet but I will afford to study well in RMIT university. Fortunately, my father has 30 years working in this area, particularly software, so he can support me to choose reasonable skills for IT information Security.</p>

									<p>According to my research, I want to gain skills about Net, C++, Java, and C#. I will obtain computer networking which is one of the most fundamental qualifications to become IT Information Security. And strong fluency English is an indispensable skill in IT.</p>

									<p>I plan to study hard in class and review it after going home. Moreover, I will engage in IT club of RMIT, and if I get stuck in any lessons, I will ask my friends or teacher to help me. </p>

										<h3>Creativity</h3>
										<p>My complexity is the highest because I always find complex work to study and figure out it. Conversely, I do not have persistence to do anything, so I need to have motivation from partners or family to solve my problems.</p>

									<li>
										<span class="icon major fas fa-assistive-listening-systems"></span>
										<h3>Style</h3>
										<p>Auditory learning are exemplified by my learning style, which means that I tend to study when information is presented in a spoken language format.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major fas fa-users"></span>
										<h3>Communication</h3>
										<p>The results of 16-personalities illustrates that I am mostly introverted and intuitive, this means I usually focus on hidden meanings and future possibilities. On the other hand, I always listen and sharing ideas with each other.</p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p class="content">This part shows my web based project idea, to be more specific, this is Advanced Transportation Training Driving School Management System, Directions and Update Traffic Situation which is called Supporting Transportation Apps. It can support for people who are driving and want to know about the unpleasant driving experiences such as weather changes, accidents, or congestion. Analyzing the car speed, suggesting the suitable speed to avoid exceeding the allowed speed and the shortest and the fastest way to destination. Moreover, people can sign up for training driving school and booking vehicles or instructors for training. This can prevent the efforts of human power and wealth, additionally, make sure that driving-training information can be utilized effectively. </p>

									<h2>Outcome</h2>
									<p>If my project is successful, reducing accidents and raising awareness when people participate in traffic will be the outcome. Money is also one result I think about because many people will install and download my app on their devices. Although Supporting Transportation App has a range of benefits, there are some negative sides as well as problems when we create this project. We must guarantee that every account is secure and money in it is not taken by hacker or penetration. Therefore, we need to create the security team who can protect user’s information and check the operation of app. From my perspective, this development will have a huge amount of impact in the world, especially in Vietnam. This is a country that is one of the highest death rates in the world due to traffic accidents.</p>
